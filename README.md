# Starbooks Challenge 

Although this challenge did not have any complex state to manage I opted to use React since it is relevant to the position and fast to get up and prototyping with. I have used JSS [See JSS](https://cssinjs.org/react-jss/?v=v10.10.0) for styling my components but could have used styled components, SCSS or even plain css.
